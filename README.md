- 👋 Hi, I’m @lschwerdfager. I am a retired computer science graduate, having been retired since 2012.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing scientific applications such as those for aerospace or defense. 
- 🌱 I'm not really learning more new languages, etc. as I believe the ideal one for me is the variation of Oberon called "Component Pascal". 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on remote scientific application development projects as an independent developer and am looking for some reasonable level of financial remuneration in so doing. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...I can be reached at lance.schwerdfager@gmail.com most of the time.
